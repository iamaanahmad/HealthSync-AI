## 🎭 Presentation Tips

### Voice & Pace
- **Speak clearly** and at moderate pace (not too fast!)
- **Pause** between major sections (2-3 seconds)
- **Emphasize** key numbers (78%, $3.2T, k=5, 99.9% faster)
- **Sound enthusiastic** but professional

### Visual Flow
- **Keep terminals visible** - show real agents working
- **Highlight key lines** in logs as you mention them
- **Use mouse cursor** to guide viewer attention
- **Zoom in** on important details if needed

### Technical Execution
- **Practice transitions** between windows
- **Have backup screenshots** in case of technical issues
- **Test recording** at least once before final take
- **Check audio levels** - clear but not too loud

### Timing Management
- **Use stopwatch** on second monitor
- **Know which sections** can be shortened if running long
- **Practice** at least 3 times to nail timing
- **Don't rush** the ending - it's your lasting impression

---

## 🚨 Backup Plans

### If Agents Not Responding
- Use pre-recorded agent logs
- Explain: "In live production, you'd see real-time logs here"
- Show screenshots of successful runs
- Focus on architecture and design

### If Running Long (>5 minutes)
**Can be shortened:**
- Scene 1 (Problem) - show diagram only, cut statistics
- Scene 2 (Architecture) - show diagram, skip individual agent details
- Scene 6 (Privacy) - show final k=5 result, skip detailed process

**Must keep full length:**
- Scene 5 (Multi-Agent Collaboration) - this is the wow factor
- Scene 8 (ASI Alliance Tech) - judges are evaluating this

### If Running Short (<4 minutes)
**Can be expanded:**
- Scene 5 (Agents) - show more detailed message flow
- Scene 6 (Privacy) - show before/after comparison
- Scene 8 (ASI Tech) - demonstrate Chat Protocol interaction
