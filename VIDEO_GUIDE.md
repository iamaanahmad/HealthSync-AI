                      ↓ (Permissions: VERIFIED ✅)
  Research Query Agent → Data Custodian Agent
                      ↓ (Data Retrieved: 47 patients ✅)
  Research Query Agent → Privacy Agent
                      ↓ (Anonymization: Applied k=5 ✅)
  Research Query Agent → Researcher (Results Ready ✅)
  ```
- Each agent contributing its specialized role
- Message timestamps showing real-time execution
- Terminal logs in background showing actual agent communication

**What's Happening:**
- This is the **magic of HealthSync**: 5 autonomous agents coordinating perfectly

  - **After**: hash_abc123, Age 30-35, ZIP 941**, [REDACTED]
- Compliance badges: HIPAA ✅ GDPR ✅

**What's Happening:**
- Raw patient data is **transformed into privacy-safe data**
- K-anonymity = Each patient indistinguishable from 4 others
- Personal identifiers = Cryptographically hashed
