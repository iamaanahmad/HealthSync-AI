## 🔄 Agent Communication Flow

### Typical Research Query Workflow

```
1. Researcher submits query via Chat Protocol
   ↓
2. Research Query Agent (8003) receives query
   ↓
3. MeTTa Integration Agent (8005) validates ethics
   → Returns: ethics_approved ✅
   ↓
4. Patient Consent Agent (8001) checks permissions
   → Returns: 47 patients consented ✅
   ↓
5. Data Custodian Agent (8002) retrieves records
   → Returns: raw_data (47 patient records)
   ↓
6. Privacy Agent (8004) anonymizes data
   → Applies: k-anonymity (k=5), differential privacy
   → Returns: anonymized_data (safe for researcher)
   ↓
7. Research Query Agent (8003) delivers results
   ↓
8. Researcher receives anonymized, ethics-compliant dataset
```

---

## ✅ Health Check Endpoints

All agents expose `/health` endpoint at their respective ports:

```bash
# Check Patient Consent Agent
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "agent_id": "patient-consent-agent",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "message_count": 142,
  "chat_protocol": "enabled"
}
```

---

## 💬 Chat Protocol Integration

All agents are discoverable and chattable via ASI:One:

### How to Interact
1. Open ASI:One interface
2. Search for "@healthsync-consent", "@healthsync-custodian", etc.
3. Start a natural language conversation
4. Agents respond with context-aware answers

### Example Conversation

**You**: "What's the status of research query #42?"

**Research Query Agent**: "Query #42: Status = In Progress. Ethics: ✅ Approved. Consent: ✅ Verified. Privacy: ⏳ Applying anonymization. ETA: 30 seconds."

---
