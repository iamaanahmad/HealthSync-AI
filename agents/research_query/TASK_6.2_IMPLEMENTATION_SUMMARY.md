# Task 6.2 Implementation Summary: Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

## Overview

Task 6.2 has been successfully implemented, enhancing the Research Query Agent with comprehensive multi-agent workflow orchestration capabilities. This implementation addresses all requirements from 4.1-4.4 with advanced error handling, recovery mechanisms, result aggregation, and audit trail generation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Agent Communication Protocols (Requirement 4.1)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Standardized Message Protocols**: All agent communications use consistent message formats with acknowledgments
- **Proper Workflow Sequencing**: Agents collaborate in the correct sequence: MeTTa → Consent → Data → Privacy
- **Message Acknowledgment System**: Every message requires acknowledgment with status tracking
- **Timeout Management**: Each step has configurable timeouts (default 5 minutes per step, 30 minutes total)

**Key Components:**
- `WorkflowStep` class with comprehensive status tracking
- Agent role-based message routing
- Standardized input/output data validation
- Real-time workflow progress monitoring

### 2. Advanced Error Handling and Recovery (Requirement 4.2)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures with configurable thresholds
- **Exponential Backoff Retry**: Smart retry strategies with agent-specific configurations
- **Step Recovery Mechanisms**: Fallback strategies for each agent type
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation with reduced functionality when possible

**Recovery Strategies by Agent:**
- **MeTTa Agent**: Fallback validation with reduced confidence scores
- **Consent Agent**: Cached consent checking for common scenarios
- **Data Custodian**: Reduced sample size recovery for partial data availability
- **Privacy Agent**: Basic anonymization when advanced methods fail

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**
```python
{
    "failure_threshold": 5,
    "recovery_timeout": 300,  # 5 minutes
    "is_open": False
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Result Aggregation (Requirement 4.3)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-Source Data Aggregation**: Combines results from all workflow steps
- **Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive quality scoring with compliance validation
- **Consent Rate Analysis**: Tracks and validates consent coverage
- **Privacy Compliance Scoring**: Ensures k-anonymity and other privacy requirements
- **Final Dataset Creation**: Produces compliant, anonymized datasets for researchers

**Aggregation Components:**
- Consent summary with threshold validation (80% required)
- Data quality scoring with completeness metrics
- Privacy compliance with k-anonymity verification (k≥5)
- Ethics validation with confidence scoring
- Overall quality grading (A-F scale)

**Quality Thresholds:**
```python
{
    "consent_threshold": 0.8,        # 80% consent required
    "data_quality_threshold": 0.7,   # 70% quality minimum
    "privacy_compliance_threshold": 0.9  # 90% privacy compliance
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Trail and Logging (Requirement 4.4)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Detailed Event Logging**: Every workflow action is logged with timestamps
- **Audit Trail Management**: Comprehensive audit trail with size management
- **Performance Metrics**: Agent-specific performance tracking
- **Workflow History**: Complete workflow execution history
- **Filterable Audit Logs**: Query audit trail by workflow, event type, or time range

**Audit Event Types:**
- `WORKFLOW_STARTED` / `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED` / `WORKFLOW_FAILED`
- `STEP_STARTED` / `STEP_COMPLETED` / `STEP_FAILED`
- `RECOVERY_ATTEMPT_STARTED` / `RECOVERY_SUCCESS_*` / `RECOVERY_FAILED`
- `RESULT_AGGREGATION_STARTED` / `RESULT_AGGREGATION_COMPLETED`

**Performance Metrics Tracked:**
- Success rates per agent (exponential moving average)
- Average response times per agent
- Total/successful/failed workflow counts
- Circuit breaker status monitoring

## Enhanced Workflow Orchestrator Features

### Configuration Management
```python
# Retry strategies per agent
retry_strategies = {
    AgentRole.METTA_AGENT: {"max_retries": 3, "backoff_factor": 2.0},

    AgentRole.DATA_CUSTODIAN: {"max_retries": 3, "backoff_factor": 2.0},
    AgentRole.PRIVACY_AGENT: {"max_retries": 2, "backoff_factor": 3.0}
}

aggregation_rules = {
    "consent_threshold": 0.8,
    "data_quality_threshold": 0.7,
    "privacy_compliance_threshold": 0.9
}
```

### Step Validation
- **Input Validation**: Each step validates required input parameters

- **Agent-Specific Validation**: Custom validation rules per agent type
- **Error Context**: Detailed error information for debugging

### Result Processing
- **Quality Grading**: A-F grading system based on overall quality
