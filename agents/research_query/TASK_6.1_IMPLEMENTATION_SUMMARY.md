### 2. Workflow Orchestration (`workflow_orchestrator.py`)

#### WorkflowOrchestrator Class
- **Purpose:** Coordinates multi-agent workflows for research query processing
- **Key Features:**
  - Sequential workflow execution across multiple agents
  - Circuit breaker pattern for agent failure handling
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery

#### Workflow Components
- **WorkflowExecution:** Complete workflow context and state

- **AgentRole Enum:** CONSENT_AGENT, DATA_CUSTODIAN, PRIVACY_AGENT, METTA_AGENT

### 3. Research Query Agent (`agent.py`)

#### ResearchQueryAgent Class
- **Purpose:** Main agent handling research query requests
- **Key Features:**
  - Message handling for research queries, status requests, cancellations
  - Query tracking and history management
  - Statistics collection and reporting
  - Integration with workflow orchestrator

#### Message Handlers
- `_handle_research_query()` - Processes incoming research queries
- `_handle_query_status()` - Provides query status information
- `_handle_query_cancellation()` - Handles query cancellation requests
- `_handle_query_history()` - Returns query history for researchers
- `_handle_health_check()` - Agent health and statistics reporting

- Circuit breaker pattern for agent failure handling
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Features:**
- Dynamic step creation based on data types and research categories
- Agent address management and routing
- Workflow status tracking and monitoring
- Error propagation and recovery mechanisms

### ✅ Requirement 4.1: Query Status Tracking and Progress Reporting

**Implementation:**

- Query history management with researcher-specific filtering
- Comprehensive statistics collection and reporting
- Workflow progress monitoring with step-level details

**Features:**
- Query lifecycle management (active → history)
- Researcher authorization for query operations
- Performance metrics and processing time tracking
- Audit trail generation for all query operations

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** 23 tests covering query validation and processing
- **Integration Tests:** Comprehensive workflow and agent integration testing
- **Validation Tests:** All requirements verified with specific test cases
